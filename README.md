##  Smart Contracts
- Smart contracts for creating ride request, picking ride by driver, checking nearby rides and other needed functions have been developed.
- A transaction for block will be created when new ride is requested by rider.
- You can check the smart contract code and transaction here : [https://explorer.apothem.network/address/xdc05dd0275a105b91f28d1478cf5696566024353a4#transactions](https://explorer.apothem.network/address/xdc05dd0275a105b91f28d1478cf5696566024353a4#transactions)
- Wallet Private key for testing in app : **05f495a3b3a457fd6fef7a437f5e2cac8c7250f634d83e1acacaeed1f7fef86f**


## Problem
With billions of taxi rides being booked online through several platforms, taxi booking websites and apps have taken over the traditional call to book or manual booking systems. The service is also rapidly increasing its users each and every year. Lakhs of drivers have started using the platform and depend on it completely.

But, the commission percentage is a way too high starting from 15% to as high as upto 40%. The riders are not happy about it. Drivers fear of slavery and reduced income, losing ownership and independence. The platforms just concentrate on their own profits.

## Solution
The above problems could be solved by developing a decentralized cab booking system.  Since the current platforms use centralised databases and communicate with the app through their servers, the platforms have the permission to decide everything, starting from fare, commission, and directions. So the platforms, after gaining popularity, just increase their commission.

What if we replaced the centralised database with a decentralised application built with blockchain, where all rides are securely recorded as smart contacts? It would increase transparency on fares, pickup and drop locations, distance and duration of trips, and thus reduce fare cheating. Also, drivers need not pay commissions to the platforms.
